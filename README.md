## Homework Challenge 9

## Description

For our 9th homework assignment we were taksed with creating a readme generator using node.js. Since this is a backend application without a front end, we will have to test the code in our terminal.

## Instalation

The user will be required to run 'npm init' to create the package.json file and followed by 'npm i' to install all dependencies.

## Usage

This application is designed to provide the user with a readme file for their repo.

## Credits

Bootcamp excersises along with help from reddit/discord mentors.
